# Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
# Classify Spambase data from UCI ML repository

import numpy as np



# 1. 
# Create training and test set:

# Read in Spambase data set
# Split instances into spam and not spam examples
# Place each type equally into test and train datasets
# Make sure each test and train have 40% spam, 60% not spam


# 2. 
# Create probabilistic model.

# Compute prior probability for each class
# 1(spam), and 0(not spam) in the training data
# *P(1) should be roughly .4
# For each of the 57 features, compute the mean and 
#  standard deviation in the training set of the values
#  given each class
# To avoid the problem any standard deviation = 0
#  add a small value - epsilon - 0.0001
#  to each standard deviation that you compute.


# 3. 
# Run Naive Bayes on the test data.

# Randomly mix all the test data
# Use Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm to classify instances in your test set,
# using the means and standard deviations computed in part 2.
# P(x_i | c_j) = N(x_i ; m_(i,c_j) , stdev_(i,c_j) )
# where
# N(x ; m , stdev) = [ (1/ (sqrt(2pi)*stdev) )*( e^ ((x-m)^2 / (2*o^2) ) ) ]# *Because product of 58 probabilities will be small, use log of product
#   since argmax f(z) = argmax log(f(z))


# In report, include:
# Description of what I did &&
# Results for test set: 
# compute accuracy
# compute precision
# compute recall
# create confusion matrix
